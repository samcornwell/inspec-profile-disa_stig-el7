  title "All local interactive user initialization files executable search paths
must contain only paths that resolve to the users home directory."
  desc  "The executable search path (typically the PATH environment variable)
contains a list of directories for the shell to search to find executables. If this
path includes the current working directory (other than the user’s home directory),
executables in these directories may be executed instead of system commands. This
variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories. If there is an empty
entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two consecutive colons, this is
interpreted as the current working directory. If deviations from the default system
search path for the local interactive user are required, they must be documented
with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO)."

Check the executable search path statement for all local interactive user
initialization files in the users' home directory with the following commands:

Note: The example will be for the smithj user, which has a home directory of
\"/home/smithj\".

# grep -i path /home/smithj/.*
/home/smithj/.bash_profile:PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin

If any local interactive user initialization files have executable search path
statements that include directories outside of their home directory, this is a
finding."
