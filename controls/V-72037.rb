  desc  "If user start-up files execute world-writable programs, especially in
unprotected directories, they could be maliciously modified to destroy user files or
otherwise compromise the system at the user level. If the system is compromised at
the user level, it is easier to elevate privileges to eventually compromise the
system at the root and network level."
