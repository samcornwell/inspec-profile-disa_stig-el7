Check the configuration of \"/etc/rsyslog.conf\" for the cron facility with the
following command:

Note: If another logging package is used, substitute the utility configuration file
for \"/etc/rsyslog.conf\".

# grep cron /etc/rsyslog.conf
cron.* /var/log/cron.log

If the command does not return a response, check for cron logging all facilities by
inspecting the \"/etc/rsyslog.conf\" file:

# more /etc/rsyslog.conf

Look for the following entry:

*.* /var/log/messages

If \"rsyslog\" is not logging messages for the cron facility or all facilities, this
is a finding.

If the entry is in the \"/etc/rsyslog.conf\" file but is after the entry \"*.*\",
this is a finding."
